I love to eat apple pie every friday to remind me of home and the good old days.

Sometimes I pick an apple from the tree on my way home but I have to run fast if old granny gray catches me.

I find adding a red apple or two to beef stew adds an interesting twist to the flavour but most other people are disgusted.
